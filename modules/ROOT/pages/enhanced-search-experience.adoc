The Exchange catalog of assets can display hundreds of assets that help developers discover assets to create projects quickly and drive adoption of best practices and reuse. You can find assets from Mulesoft's ecosystem or your own organization. Based on your permision group, you can search multiple business groups, documentation, tags, custom attributes, and details from API specifications. To help find assets, searches can be refined using search terms like a name of an API, by filters like organizations, categories, tags, and lifecycle states, or by ranking


== Filter

Use filters to refine your search results. You can filter using the following options:

 * Type
 * Organization
 * Category
 * Tag
 * Lifecycle state

To filter search results use the search drop-down menus on the landing page.

== Sort

Search results can be sorted by the following options:

* Relevance
* Name
* Last modified
* Rating

To sort the ranking of search results, use the Sort by drop-down menu to choose Relevance (default), Name, Last modified, or Rating. Relevance sorts the matching results by where a match is found in the asset metadata, such as name, title, pages, and API specification metadata. API specification metadata includes endpoints and types.

== Search Organizations

You can select which of the organizations are visible to you to include in each search.
