= Autocataloging APIs Using API Catalog CLI

API Catalog CLI enables you to discover and catalog your API specifications, documentation files, and associated metadata as part of an automated process. You can embed the publish asset command in your automation tools, such as a CI/CD pipeline or custom scripts, to automatically trigger the cataloging of your API assets. API Catalog CLI is agnostic of CI/CD tools and runtime environments.
