Download lets you download a copy of the asset, or in the case of a Custom asset, the optional file attached to the asset when it was created.

After creating a REST asset, Exchange generates a Mule 3 connector and a Mule 4 connector. Exchange also generates an OAS 2.0 version for RAML assets, and a RAML version for OAS 2.0 and OAS 3.0 assets. After you create a new REST asset it may take a few minutes for these assets to appear on the Download menu.

When you change the asset name, description, labels, or categories of the REST asset, Exchange updates these attributes for the generated connectors.

RAML versions have been automatically generated for all OAS assets published since xref:release-notes::exchange/anypoint-exchange-release-notes.adoc#january-2019[January 12, 2019], and OAS 2.0 versions have been automatically generated for all RAML assets published since that date. If you find an older asset that does not include one of these versions, you can generate all versions by downloading the asset and uploading it again.
