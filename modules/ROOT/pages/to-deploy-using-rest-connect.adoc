The Exchange backend uses REST Connect to transparently convert a REST API specification to a Mule 3 and Mule 4 connector. You can use this connector as you would any other in Anypoint Studio.

The Anypoint Exchange Download button lets you download the Mule 3 or Mule 4 Connector.

REST Connect does not currently support custom TLS configurations.

== Access Generated Connectors

In Exchange, you can download the Mule 3 or Mule 4 connector from the *Download* menu:


NOTE: After deploying a REST asset to Exchange, refresh your screen to ensure that all download options are available.

The Mule 3 connector downloads as a zip file, and the Mule 4 connector downloads as a JAR file.

== API Specification Format Support

REST Connect has support for these API specification formats:

* OAS 3 - JSON
* OAS 3 - YAML
* OAS 2 - JSON
* OAS 2 - YAML
* RAML 1.0

== Security Scheme Support

REST Connect supports these security schemes:

* Basic Authentication
* OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials
* OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code
* Pass Through
* Digest Authentication

If you publish an API specification with another authentication type, you may receive an alert email. To have an auto-generated connector, update your API specification to use one of these supported security schemes.

If the operations defined in your API specification support multiple security schemes, the one that comes first in the list of supported schemes is selected.

Basic Authentication Example:

== Change an Auto-Generated Connector Name

REST Connect generates the names of operations based on operationName, displayName, and endpoint in that order. To modify a generated name, you can point to the REST Connect library and use the operationName annotation from a method such as GET, POST, and DELETE, or you can change the text in displayName under the method.

Example with displayName:

[source,text,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Sample API
baseUri: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
version: 0.1
mediaType: application/json

  ...
  /{postId}:
    uriParameters:
      postId: integer

    get:
      displayName: Get a post by ID.
      responses:
        200:
          body:
            type: Post
----

Example with REST Connect library:

[source,text,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Sample API
baseUri: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
version: 0.1
mediaType: application/json

uses:
  rest-connect: exchange_modules/org.mule.connectivity/rest-connect-library/1.0.0/rest-connect-library.raml

  ...
  /{postId}:
    uriParameters:
      postId: integer

    get:
      (rest-connect.operationName): Retrieve a post by id
      displayName: Get a post by ID.
      responses:
        200:
          body:
            type: Post
----


== Metadata Limitations

REST Connect generates metadata for each operation based on your schema definition in the request and response for each method in your RAML. REST Connect cannot generate metadata based on examples in the RAML.

Because only one input/output type is supported for each operation, REST Connect selects the first one that was declared. You can change this behavior by using the 'default' property from the REST Connect library.

Example with REST Connect library:

[source,text,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Sample API
baseUri: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
version: 0.1
mediaType: application/json

uses:
  rest-connect: exchange_modules/org.mule.connectivity/rest-connect-library/1.0.0/rest-connect-library.raml

  ...
  /{postId}:
    uriParameters:
      postId: integer

    get:
      displayName: Get a post by ID.
      responses:
        200:
          body:
            application/json:
             type: string
            application/xml:
             (rest-connect.default): //this sets application/xml response by default
             type: string

. Create a new API specification project named Github API in Design Center, and copy and paste the example above. From the API Designer, click Publish to Exchange:
+
image::rest-connect-publish-to-exchange.png[]
+
. Create a simple Mule application in Design Center of an HTTP Listener, the Github API, and a Logger. This app listens to `+https://my-app.cloudhub.io/getIssues+` and returns the results based on your search term.
+
image::rest-connect-dc-flow.png[]
+
. Configure OAuth 2.0 with authorization code for a connector. Most of the fields are auto-populate based in the GitHub API specification.
+
image::rest-connect-api-config.png[]
+
. Get the Client ID and Client Secret for your GitHub Account. You can find your Client ID and Client Secret if you go to Settings > Developer settings in GitHub. If you don’t have an OAuth App in GitHub, you can  create one with the New OAuth App.
. Because GitHub API’s base URL is api.github.com, you can put “/” in the Base Path.
. Match and modify your external callback URL. The callback URL receives an access token from GitHub. By default, the connector shows `+http://my-app.cloudhub.io/callback+`, but you need to modify it specific to your app. The demo app’s callback URL should be `+http://githubapp-smky.cloudhub.io/callback+` so I need to replace “my-app” with “githubapp-smky.” You can find this information to go to the menu and select the copy link in Design Center.
+
image::rest-connect-ready-to-deploy.png[]
+
. After you get your external callback URL, specify the same URL in your GitHub settings.
+
image::rest-connect-auth-callback-url.png[]
+
. You are ready to retrieve an access token from GitHub. In this case, go to `+http://githubapp-smky.cloudhub.io/authorize+` in a browser, your case would be `+http://my-app.cloudhub.io/authorize+` - replace my-app.cloudhub.io with the one you get with Copy link. When you reach this URL, your browser asks you to log into GitHub.
. When your access token is issued properly, you can get issues related to Salesforce from GitHub by using `+http://my-app.cloudhub.io/getIssues+` - my-app.cloudhub.io should be replaced with the one you get with `Copy link`.

== Known limitations
  - Anypoint platform, including REST Connect, does not support API fragments for OAS.
