The Exchange backend uses REST Connect to transparently convert a REST API specification to a Mule 3 or Mule 4 connector. You can use this connector as you would any other in Anypoint Studio.

[[access-generated-connectors]]
== Access Generated Connectors

In Exchange, download the generated connector from the *Download* menu.

[NOTE]
After deploying a REST asset to Exchange, refresh your screen to ensure that all download options are available.

Mule 3 connectors download as ZIP files, and Mule 4 connectors download as JAR files.

[[api-spec-support]]
== API Specification Format Support

REST Connect supports these API specification formats:

* OAS 3 - JSON
* OAS 3 - YAML
* OAS 2 - JSON
* OAS 2 - YAML
* RAML 1.0

[[security-scheme-support]]
== Security Scheme Support

REST Connect supports these security schemes:

* Basic Authentication
* OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials
* OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code
* Pass Through
* Digest Authentication

If you publish an API specification with an unsupported authentication type, you receive an alert email. If this happens, update your API specification to use one of the supported security schemes.

If the operations defined in your API specification support multiple security schemes, the one that comes first in the list of supported schemes is used.

[[change-connector-name]]
== Change an Auto-Generated Connector's Name

REST Connect generates the names of operations based on the `operationName`, `displayName`, and `endpoint` attributes, in that order. 

To modify a generated connector name, change the text in `displayName`, for example:

[source,text,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Sample API
baseUri: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
version: 0.1
mediaType: application/json

  ...
  /{postId}:
    uriParameters:
      postId: integer

    get:
      displayName: Get a post by ID.
      responses:
        200:
          body:
            type: Post
----

You can also modify a generated connector name by pointing to the REST Connect library and using the `operationName` annotation from a method such as GET, POST, and DELETE, for example:

[source,text,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Sample API
baseUri: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
version: 0.1

  ...
  /{postId}:
    uriParameters:
      postId: integer

    get:
      (rest-connect.operationName): Retrieve a post by id
      displayName: Get a post by ID.
      responses:
        200:
          body:
            type: Post
----



[[metadata-limitations]]
== Metadata Limitations

REST Connect generates metadata for each operation based on your schema definition in the request and response for each method in your RAML. REST Connect cannot generate metadata based on examples in the RAML.

REST Connect supports only one input/output type and uses the first one declared in the API specification. You can change this behavior by using the 'default' property from the REST Connect library.

The following is an example that uses the REST Connect library:

[source,text,linenums]

baseUri: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
version: 0.1

             type: string
            application/xml:
             (rest-connect.default): //this sets application/xml response by default
             type: string

[[reserved-keywords]]
== Reserved Keywords

Valid identifiers for REST Connect must not use any reserved Java keywords or reserved Mule keywords.

The following list shows the reserved Java keywords to avoid when naming valid identifiers for REST Connect:

* `abstract`
* `assert`
* `boolean`
* `break`
* `byte`
* `case`
* `catch`
* `char`
* `class`
* `const`
* `continue`

The following list shows the reserved Mule keywords to avoid when naming valid identifiers for REST Connect:

* `friendlyName`
* `name`
* `operationName`
* `target`
* `targetValue`

[[tls-support]]
== Generating Connectors With TLS Support

Mule 4 (SmartConnector) connectors support Transport Layer Security (TLS). When you enable TLS support and generate the connector, the connector is upgraded to run on Mule runtime 4.6. and TLS is enabled so that Anypoint Studio displays the appropriate form to collect required TLS connection configuration information for the connector. 

To enable TLS, add a `properties.json` file to the root directory of your Design Center API project for your app: 

. In Design Center, Select *Files +* > *New file*.  
. In the *Add new file* window, select *API format > other*, name the file `properties.json`, then click *Create*.
. In the new file, add `"tlsEnabled": true`.
+
[NOTE]
Add the `properties.json` file only if you want to enable TLS support or explicitly opt out of it. If you don't add a `properties.json` file to your API project, the REST Connect Service generates the standard connector artifacts, without TLS support.

After you add the `properties.json` file and enable TLS, Anypoint Studio displays the TLS configuration form for the connector.  
 
When you add a `properties.json` file to your project, ensure that the `tlsEnabled` property is correctly set with a valid boolean value of either `true` to enable TLS or `false` to explicitly disable TLS. If the `properties.json` file is invalid or if the property is incorrectly set, the connector generation is aborted.

[[upgrade-rest-connector]]
== Upgrading a REST Connect Generated Connector

To update your REST Connect generated connector to use the latest version of Mule runtime and to be compatible with Java 17:

. In Design Center, open your API project. 
. Click *Publish*. 
+
The connector is re-generated. 

If you want to add <<tls-support,TLS support>> to your application, it is a good idea to add it before re-generating the connector so you only have to test your app once. 

//// 
Does not work. Screen shots are outdated, steps are missing. This needs to be updated before it's published again. 
== OAuth2 in Design Center for REST Connect

. Create a new API specification project named `GitHub API` in Design Center, and copy and paste the previous example into the project. 
. Define an API with OAuth2 - Authorization Code and one operation in Design Center, for example:

. Click *Publish* to publish the API specification to Exchange so you can use it in your Mule app later.
. In the Publishing to Exchange window, accept the default values and click *Publish to Exchange*.
+
. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule application with an HTTP Listener, the GitHub API you created in the previous step, and a Logger. 
+
This app listens to `+https://my-app.cloudhub.io/getIssues+` and returns the results based on your search term.

Most of the fields are auto-populated based in the GitHub API specification.

. Get the Client ID and Client Secret for your GitHub Account. You can find your Client ID and Client Secret if you go to Settings > Developer settings in GitHub. If you don’t have an OAuth App in GitHub, you can  create one with the New OAuth App.
. Because GitHub API’s base URL is api.github.com, you can put “/” in the Base Path.
. Match and modify your external callback URL. The callback URL receives an access token from GitHub. 
+
By default, the connector shows `+http://my-app.cloudhub.io/callback+`, but you need to modify it to be specific to your app. The demo app’s callback URL is `+http://githubapp-smky.cloudhub.io/callback+`, so replace “my-app” with “githubapp-smky.” You can find this information to go to the menu and select the copy link in Design Center.
+
image::rest-connect-ready-to-deploy.png[]
+
. After you get your external callback URL, specify the same URL in your GitHub settings.
+
image::rest-connect-auth-callback-url.png[]
+
You are ready to retrieve an access token from GitHub. 
+
. Go to `+http://githubapp-smky.cloudhub.io/authorize+` in a browser, for example `+http://my-app.cloudhub.io/authorize+`.
. Replace `my-app.cloudhub.io` with the one you got when you copied the link. 
. Log in to GitHub.
+
When your access token is issued properly, you can get issues related to Salesforce from GitHub by using `+http://my-app.cloudhub.io/getIssues+` - my-app.cloudhub.io should be replaced with the one you get with `Copy link`.

== Known Limitations

* Anypoint Platform, including REST Connect, does not support API fragments for OAS.
* TLS support can be enabled only for Mule 4 (SmartConnector) connectors. This feature is not supported for Mule 3 (DevKit).
