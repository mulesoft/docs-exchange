Each asset in Exchange is versioned. You can manage which versions are visible by deprecating a version to hide it, and delete versions if needed. All versions of an asset always have the same type.

In addition to asset versions, APIs have a consumer facing API version that is shown at the top of an asset's detail screen. This API version is defined by API providers.

Exchange asset versions follow the https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning] model of major, minor, and patch releases. For example, if an asset is version 2.4.6, then its major version is 2.x.x, its minor version is 2.4.x, and its patch version is 2.4.6.

To select a minor version of an asset, use the menu next to the asset name at the top of the asset portal. To select a patch version of an asset, use the version list at the right.

RAML versions have been automatically generated for all OAS assets published since xref:release-notes::exchange/anypoint-exchange-release-notes.adoc#january-2019[January 12, 2019], and OAS 2.0 versions have been automatically generated for all RAML assets published since that date.
