With the Anypoint Exchange https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/exchange-maven-facade-api-http/[Maven Facade API], Apache Maven clients can publish and consume Exchange assets, including these asset types:

* Connectors
* Mule applications
* Examples
* Templates
* Policies
* Custom assets

The Exchange Maven Facade API does not support deleting assets. To delete an asset, use the Exchange user interface or the Exchange API.

The Exchange Maven Facade API does not support dynamic parameters such as setting the asset version to `1.0.${revision}`.

New assets count toward your organization's xref:to-create-an-asset.adoc#asset-limits[asset limit].

== Prerequisites

To benefit from this documentation, you must be familiar with Maven, programming concepts, and command line
operations on your computer or server.

Include the required plugin `org.mule.tools.maven.mule-maven-plugin` in your POM file. Do not include the plugin `org.apache.maven.plugins.maven-deploy-plugin` in your POM file or settings file, because it is not compatible with the required plugin.

If you use the Anypoint Exchange Maven Facade API version 3 to publish assets to Exchange, you must have the Mule Maven plugin version 3.5.0 or later.

You must have a unique artifact name and organization ID to publish your asset.

The US cloud and EU cloud use slightly different URLs, as shown in the examples.

== View Your Organization ID

To construct the elements of a Maven POM file, you need to determine your organization ID:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform and click *Access Management*.
. Click the name of the top-level organization or a business group, and view your organization ID in the organization information screen.
. Copy the organization ID so you can add it to your project's POM file for the following examples.

== Publish an Asset to Exchange Using Maven

Refer to examples of publishing each asset type with Maven in the repository located at `https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/exchange-documentation-samples`.

The steps to publish an asset with Maven are slightly different for each asset type, and different assets use different Maven plugins, so check the examples in the repository for an example that matches your asset type. For example, use `exchange-mule-maven-plugin` to publish a custom asset, and use `mule-maven-plugin` to publish an extension.

The following example shows how to publish a Mule 4 asset such as an application, example, or template.

. In your project's POM file, set `groupId` to your organization ID:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
 ...
 <groupId>ORGANIZATION_ID</groupId>
 ...
----
+
If you are publishing your asset to the master organization, the group ID is the same as the organization ID.
The URL format is:
+
`+https://maven.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v3/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/maven+`
+
In the EU, use:
+
`+https://maven.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v3/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/maven+`
+
If you are publishing your asset to a business group, the group ID is the same as the business group ID.
The URL format is:
+
`+https://maven.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v3/organizations/BUSINESS_GROUP_ID/maven+`
+
In the EU, use:
+
`+https://maven.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v3/organizations/BUSINESS_GROUP_ID/maven+`
+
. In your project's POM file, include `mule-maven-plugin` and set the correct classifier (in this example `mule-application-example`).
+
In this example, it is not necessary to set the asset type because it is inferred from the classifier:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
...
<name>Hello World Application Example</name>
<description>A mule application example uploaded using Exchange Maven Facade v3</description>
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.mule.tools.maven</groupId>
            <artifactId>mule-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.5.0</version>
            <extensions>true</extensions>
            <configuration>
                <classifier>mule-application</classifier>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
...
----
+
You must set the `<classifier>` element to make the asset visible in Exchange.
+
The `name` property is required and represents the visible name of the asset. If you are publishing the first version of a GA (GroupId and AssetId combination), the asset name is taken from the POM file. If there is already at least one version of the GA, the `name` property is ignored. You can change the name in the asset portal as described in xref:to-describe-an-asset.adoc[Describe an Asset].
+
The `description` property is optional and represents the description of the asset. If you are publishing the first version of a GA (GroupId and AssetId combination), the asset description is taken from the POM file. If there is already at least one version of the GA, the `description` property is ignored. You can change the description in the asset portal as described in xref:to-describe-an-asset.adoc[Describe an Asset].
+
Deploy Mule 3 applications by setting the property `<type>` to `app`. The asset is not displayed in the Exchange asset list.
+
Deploy Mule 3 `templates` and `examples` by using Anypoint Studio 6.3 or later.
+
For Mule 4 assets, do not specify the `<type>` element. In the `mule-maven-plugin` configuration, set `<classifier>` as `mule-application` (default), `mule-application-template`, `mule-application-example`, or `mule-policy`.
+
. Add the Maven facade as a repository in the distribution management section of your project's POM file:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
 ...
  <distributionManagement>
    <repository>
      <id>Repository</id>
      <name>Corporate Repository</name>
      <url>https://maven.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v3/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/maven</url>
      <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
  ...
----
+
In the EU, use:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
 ...
  <distributionManagement>
    <repository>
      <id>Repository</id>
      <name>Corporate Repository</name>
      <url>https://maven.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v3/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/maven</url>
      <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
  ...
----
+
The `<id>` and `<name>` elements are arbitrary names that you create to identify the repository and any other organizational identifiers. The `<id>` value must be the same in the `pom.xml` file as in the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file. The `<id>` value connects the `pom.xml` file with information to log in to the organization's URL.
+
. Update the `settings.xml` file in your Maven `.m2` directory.
+
After you install Maven, the `mvn clean` command creates the `.m2` directory. The directory is `~/.m2` on macOS or Linux and `<default-drive>\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\.m2` on Windows. It contains your Anypoint Platform credentials. The Maven client reads the settings file when Maven runs.
+
Example `settings.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>Repository</id>
      <username>myusername</username>
      <password>mypassword</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----
+
. Publish your asset to Exchange using this Maven command:
+
[source,console]
----
mvn deploy
----
. Search Exchange for the asset ID to find the asset.

== Publish a Custom Asset

Publish custom assets with the `exchange-mule-maven-plugin` plugin. The latest version of this plugin is 0.0.13.

This example shows the `build` section of `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.mule.tools.maven</groupId>
            <artifactId>exchange-mule-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.13</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>validate</id>
                    <phase>validate</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>exchange-pre-deploy</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
                <execution>
                    <id>deploy</id>
                    <phase>deploy</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>exchange-deploy</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

=== Troubleshooting

If the build fails during the deploy stage with a status code of 412 (Precondition Failed), then `<goal>exchange-pre-deploy</goal>` was not executed. To fix this error, ensure that goal is set inside the executions section of the plugin.

The error looks similar to this:

[source,console]

== Publish and Consume Federated Assets

. xref:access-management::saml-bearer-token.adoc[Get an API bearer token by using a SAML assertion].
+
This is your access token.
+
. Open the `settings.xml` file at `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\.m2\settings.xml` on Windows, or at `+~/.m2/settings.xml+` on macOS or Linux.
. Do not change the value in `<username>`.
+
This value tells the platform that you're using a token.
+
. Set the value in `<password>` to your access token:

----
+
. Save the `settings.xml` file.

== Dependencies external to Exchange

Publish Java libraries and POM files as Exchange custom assets.

Mule 4 Extensions that declare dependencies that don't exist in Maven Central or the MuleSoft Maven repositories are not currently supported.

== Document Your Exchange Assets

When you use Maven Facade to publish an asset to Exchange, a documentation portal is automatically created for it in Exchange and you can xref:to-describe-an-asset.adoc[document it normally].

== Consume an Exchange Asset with Maven

With Maven Facade you can consume assets published in Exchange, including connectors, Mule applications, and REST APIs. To consume an Exchange asset, add the asset's group ID, artifact ID, and version to the `dependencies` section of your project's `pom.xml` file,
and add the Maven facade as a repository in the `repositories` section.

Replace `ORGANIZATION_ID` with your organization ID.

You can use `+https://maven.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v3/maven+` as a valid URL for the `+<url>+` value, because this is the default to publish to the master organization. In the EU, use `+https://maven.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v3/maven+` as the URL.

In the EU, the <repositories> section is:
