Use your organization's public portal to publish API assets for viewing and use by developers inside and outside your organization.

A public portal is visible to anyone who has the URL of the portal. The URL for a public portal starts with `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/Domain_Name/+`.

Replace `Domain_Name` with the domain name shown in Anypoint access management on the xref:access-management::organization.adoc#organization-page[*Organization* page].

== Permissions to Control Asset Publishing

An organization's Exchange administrators add assets to the public portal and remove assets from the public portal.

Grant the Exchange administrator permission to a user or revoke the permission from a user with Anypoint Access Management.

For more information see xref:to-set-permissions.adoc[Set User Access Permissions].
