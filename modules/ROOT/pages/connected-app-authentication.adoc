= Connected Application Authentication

Connected application authentication allows access to Exchange using the client application credentials of client ID and client secret, so you can execute Exchange requests without sending a token.

To create a new connected application:

. Log in to Anypoint.
. Go to *Access Management* > *Connected Apps* > *Create App*.
. Choose "App acts on its own behalf (client credentials)" and ensure the application has either the scope *Exchange Administrator* or the scope *Exchange Contributor*.
. Click *Save* and copy the client ID and client secret of the connected application.

To use connected application authentication, provide basic authentication and define the username as `\~~~Client\~~~` and the password as `clientId\~?~clientSecret`. Replace `clientId` with the client ID. Replace `clientSecret` with the client secret.
