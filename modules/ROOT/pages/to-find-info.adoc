The Exchange catalog of assets can display hundreds of assets that help developers discover assets to create projects quickly and drive adoption of best practices and reuse. You can find assets from Mulesoft's ecosystem or your own organization. Based on your permission group, you can search multiple business groups, documentation, tags, custom attributes, and details from API specifications. 

To help find assets, searches can be refined using search terms like a name of an API, by filters like organizations, categories, tags, and lifecycle states, or by ranking.

Anypoint Exchange search looks for terms in:

* Each asset’s name
* Description
* Contact name and email
* Tags
* Categories
* The content of the asset portal pages
* Properties defined in RAML and OAS API specifications

== Search by Keyword 

You can use the *Search assets* box to find assets by keyword.

. Click one or more options from the menu and click *Apply*. 
. To clear a filter option, click *Clear filter*.
. To clear all filter options, click *Clear all filters*.

=== Filter By Custom Fields
Custom fields are created by Exchange administrators and organization owners using the Exchange API to extend the Exchange asset metadata model and add custom data to any type of asset. The custom field filter lets you refine a search using preset information.


The custom field filter has the following data types:

[%header,cols="1a,1a,2a"]
|===
|Data Type |Example Name for Data Type|Operator
|Enum|Days of the week|Contains and not contains. The default value is contains.
|Number|Quantity |Equals, not equals to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to. The default value is equals.
|Date |Release Date |Equals, not equals to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to. The default value is equals.
|Text|Team |Equals and not equals to. The default value is equals.
|List of numbers|Orders |Contains and not contains. The default value is contains.
|List of strings|Emails |Contains and not contains. The default value is contains.
|===

Use preset operators to filter the search results. The values of the operators can be changed and customized. For example, you can select a date from the list of the values or add a date by entering a custom date in the defined format (YYY-MM-DD). The customized value shows in the list of options as freeform.

== Sort Search Results

You can sort the ranking of search results. Assets can be sorted by the following options:

* Relevance
+
Sorts the matching results by where a match is found in the asset metadata, such as name, title, pages, and API specification metadata. API specification metadata includes endpoints and types. A search term must be entered to see the *Relevance* option in the *Sort by* list. When you search by a term, assets are sorted by *Relevance* by default.  
* Name
+
Sorts by asset name in ascending alphabetical order.
* Last modified
+
Sorts the results by the most recently modified assets at the top, for example, the latest published assets or assets that have new versions recently added. This is the default for all business groups except assets that are provided by Mulesoft.
* Rating
+
Sorts by descending order by the review rating of an asset (stars on an asset card). The highest rated assets is at the top. 
* Featured
+
Sorts by placing a featured selection of assets at the top of the results. This is the default order for the Provided by MuleSoft and Global Exchange. Other assets that are not featured assets are ordered by last modified. The sorting options appear when they are available within an organization.

To sort the ranking of search results, use the *Sort by* drop-down menu to select an option: Relevance, Name, Last modified, Rating, Relevance, or Featured.
