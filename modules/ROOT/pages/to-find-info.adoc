Anypoint Exchange search looks for terms in:

. Each asset’s name
. Tags
. Categories
. Custom attributes (also known as custom fields)
. The content of the asset portal pages
. Properties defined in RAML and OAS API specifications

In an asset portal, click a tag or category element to create a filtered search showing similar assets.

The original Exchange search experience is available in Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, MuleSoft Government Cloud, the US cloud, and the EU cloud. The new Exchange search experience is available in the US cloud and the EU cloud. The new search includes more options for search ranking, and more options and a better interface for searching by types, tags, categories, organizations, and lifecycle states.

== Types, Categories, Tags, Lifecycle States and Ranking in the New Exchange Search Experience

To filter search results by type, categories, tags,and lifecycle states in the new Exchange search experience, use the drop-down menus on the search page.

To select the ranking of search results in the new Exchange search experience, use the Sort by drop-down menu to choose Relevance (default), Name, Last modified, or Rating. Relevance sorts the matching results by where a match is found in the asset metadata, such as name, title, pages, and API specification metadata. API specification metadata includes endpoints and types.

== Searching in Organizations

In the original Exchange search experience, searches apply only to the Exchange organization you are viewing. If you are viewing a private Exchange organization, the search lists only that organization’s assets and not MuleSoft public assets.

In the new Exchange search experience, you can select which of the organizations are visible to you to include in each search. 


== Save a Search

Use the same method to save searches in either the original Exchange search experience or the new Exchange search experience:

. Enter a search term and click *Save This Search*.
. When prompted, give the search a name and select whether the search is an organization search or personal search.
+
Administrators can save searches visible to anyone in their current business group. Personal searches are visible only to the person who creates them.
. Save the search.
. Confirm that your search appears in the saved searches in the left navigation bar.
+
Exchange lists search terms specific to your business group. Below those terms are saved searches you created:

== Search API Specifications

The following API specification properties are used in search:

* API title
* Base URI
* Endpoints
** Path
** Display name
** Description
* Methods
** Method type (GET, POST, PUT)
** Description
* Query parameters
** Name
** Description
* URI parameters
** Name
* Types
** Name
** Properties
* Traits
* Properties
* Security schemas

These property names are based on RAML specifications. Equivalent properties are indexed for OAS specifications. For example, RAML uses base URI but OAS uses host and path.

This example shows an API specification:

Note that the last two searches are the same, because special characters are removed before searching.

== Search for Phrases by Using the Original Search Experience

Using the original Exchange search experience, to search for case-insensitive text that begins with each word you specify, put a space between words. This is similar to putting the `*` wildcard regular expression after each word. For example, searching for `mq module` finds any asset that has text that starts with `mq` or `module`.

Searching for a multiple word phrase shows assets that have every word in the phrase.

If you separate search words with any non-alphanumeric character other than a space, Anypoint Exchange converts the character to a space before searching.

=== Search Phrases 

To search for case-insensitive text that begins with each word you specify, put a space between words.
This is similar to putting the `*` wildcard regular expression after each word.
For example, searching for `mq module` finds any asset that has text that
starts with `mq` or `module`.

Searching for a multiple word phrase shows assets that have every word in the phrase.

If you separate search words with any non-alphanumeric character other than a space, Anypoint Exchange
converts the character to a space before searching.

=== Search Separators

The original Exchange search experience uses search separators to find Exchange assets that contain one or more terms.

If you input search words connected by non-alphanumeric symbols, Exchange replaces the symbols with spaces before searching for the term. The search string only succeeds if both words are present in the result. This is the same as the `word1 AND word2` relationship.

Example search terms:

[source,text,linenums]
----
sales:connect
Sales-Connect
connect:/sales
-connect -sales
----

This table shows how each search term is interpreted based on the values in the asset name,
asset ID, and tags for an asset. If the search term maps to the values correctly, a match occurs. If not,
the reason is provided.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Asset Name |Asset ID |Tags |Matches?
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |mule-Connector |Yes
|Salesforce Connector |salesforce-connector |REST |Yes
|Validations API |validations-api |salesforce-connecting |Yes
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, salesforce:enabled |Yes
|Cisco Sales API  |cisco-sales-api |Connecting, Productive |Yes
|Cisco Connector |cisco-connector |com.cisco.connector.sales
|Yes, because the tag is split into separate terms.
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |muleconnector, MuleConnector |No. `connect` was not found.
|Salesforce Connec |salesforce-connec |REST |No. `connect` was not found.
|Validations API |validations-api |connector |No. `sales` was not found.
|Cisco Presales API |cisco-presales-api |Connector, api |No. `sales` was not found.
|===

=== Phrase Search Separators

Use phrase search to find a group of terms inside quotation marks. Phrase searches match an asset only if all the exact terms inside quotes appear in consecutive order.

If you input any of these searches in Exchange, Exchange replaces non-alphanumeric symbols with spaces before searching for assets.

Example search terms:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Api: "Sales connect"
Api "Sales-connect"
Api "Sales:/connect"
Api-"Sales/connect"
"Sales connect":Api
----

This table shows how each search term is interpreted based on the values in the asset name,
asset ID, and tags for an asset. If the search term maps to the values correctly, a match occurs. If not,
the reason is provided.

|Asset Name |Asset ID |Tags |Matches?
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |mule-Connector |No. `sales connect` was not found.
|Salesforce Connector |salesforce-connector |REST |No
|Sales Connect Asset |validations-api |mule-connector |Yes
|Sales Connect Images |validations-images |mule-connector |No. `api` was not found.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, sales:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/sales, connect:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found, because each term is in different tags.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |sales:/connect |Yes

== Search by Types, Tags, Categories, and Custom Fields in the Original Exchange Search Experience

In the original Exchange search experience, you can enter search text to search for assets. Click *All Types* to set a filter for specific asset types, or combine search text with the filters listed in the type menu.


The original Exchange search experience uses query language to search assets by tags, categories, and custom fields.

=== Search by Tags

Search by tags using either `tag:"some value"` or `tag:value`.

If the value has no spaces, then double quotes are optional.

Tag search is case-insensitive.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Tags |Matches?
|tag:"some value" |some value |Yes
|tag:"some value" |value |No
|tag:"value" |value |Yes
|tag:value |value |Yes
|tag:VALUE |value |Yes
|tag:VaLuE |value |Yes
|tag:value |val |No
|===

=== Search by Categories

Search by categories using `category:"some key" = "some value"`.

If the category has no spaces in the key or value, then double quotes are optional.

The key can include the asterisk (`*`) regular expression to search for characters within a category name.

The key is case-sensitive.

A search value matches an asset value if either of these is true:

* The search value is entirely lowercase.
* The letter case of the search value and the asset value match.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Category |Matches?
|category:my-key = my-value |my-key:my-value |Yes
|category:my-key = MY-VALUE |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|category:my-key = my-value |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|category:"my key" = "my value" |my key:my value |Yes
|category:"key" = "value" |my key:my value |No
|category:key = value |my-key:my-value |No
|category:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|category:*my.key = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|category:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|category:this.* = some-* |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|===

You can search for a combination of different categories. You cannot search for multiple values of the same category.

Multiple search terms use an implicit `AND`. `OR` is not supported.

These search terms return all assets marked as both system APIs and Salesforce products:

`category:"API Type" = "System API" category:"Product" = "Salesforce"`

=== Search by Custom Fields

Search by fields using `field:"some key" = "some value"`.

If the custom field has no spaces in the key or value, then double quotes are optional.

The key can include the asterisk (`*`) regular expression to search for characters within a field name.

The key is case-sensitive.

A search value matches an asset value if either of these is true:

* The search value is entirely lowercase.
* The letter case of the search value and the asset value match.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Field |Matches?
|field:my-key = my-value |my-key:my-value |Yes
|field:my-key = MY-VALUE |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|field:my-key = my-value |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|field:my-key = My-ValUe |my-key:MY-VALUE |No
|field:MY-KEY = my-value |my-key:my-value |No
|field:my-key = 10 |my-key:10 |Yes
|field:"my key" = "my value" |my key:my value |Yes
|field:"key" = "value" |my key:my value |No
|field:key = value |my-key:my-value |No
|field:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|field:*my.key = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|field:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|field:this.* = some-* |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|===
