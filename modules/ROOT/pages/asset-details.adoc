The asset details page provides comprehensive information about an asset. You can view version agnostic information, share the asset with others or publish it on the public portal, download a copy of the asset, view code, manage versions and lifecycle states, add categories and tags, edit the documentation, and test API endpoints. 

The current documentation provides information about the new UI for the asset details page, which includes the lifecycle states feature. The previous UI does not include lifecycle states. 

See xref:workflow-sharing-assets.adoc[Workflow: Publish Assets] for more information about performing these functions.

Select an asset in Exchange to view the asset details page:

image::exchange-asset-detail-view.png[Asset details]

The left navigation bar lists:

* Additional pages
* Saved search terms
* Application names
* Instances
* The HTTP functions in the REST specification (for a REST API)
* Conformance Status
* Terms and conditions and APIs using this policy (for a policy)

The top asset detail pane provides the following information:

* Asset name 
* Description
* Asset type
* Organization
* Contact name
* Contact email
* Asset creation date 
* Last updated date
* Version 
* Categories and tags of the asset
* Lifecycle state
* Conformance state
* Share by inviting users to have access
* For APIs, download specifications and view code
* Add a new version

For REST APIs, use the right pane to create example calls and mock data to test the API.

From the asset details pane, you can collapse and expand metadata such as version, last published, and categories and tags. See version information by clicking *View versions*. Administrators can use *Manage versions* to add a new version of the asset, view version details, and delete a version. See xref:manage-versions.adoc[Manage Versions] for more information.

The documentation page displays the asset documentation. The documentation can be edited by an administrator or the asset owner by clicking *Edit documentation*. 

== View Assets by Business Group

A system administrator groups individuals within an organization into business groups. Each group has its own Exchange assets. 

To view the business groups, log in to Anypoint Platform and click a group name from the taskbar:

image::ex2-biz-groups.png[Screenshot - Business groups in upper taskbar drop-down menu]

An Exchange administrator sets the groups that this menu displays for each user.

If you cannot find an asset in the current business group scopes, search in other scopes. In the left navigation menu click *All assets* (assets provided by MuleSoft and your own root organization), *Provided by MuleSoft*, or a business group scope.

== View REST API Elements in an Asset

View RAML, OAS, or AsyncAPI API specification information, including resources and the methods in each resource, in the left navigation bar.

. Click a method button:
+
image::ex2-rest-ftns.png[Screenshot - REST API function buttons in left nav bar]
+
. Experiment with the API in the right side of a method view.
+
This is similar to using a program such as Postman to specify custom HTTP headers and test each API's method using the API's endpoint.
. To connect the API to one of your applications and use the API to send and receive data, click *Request access*.

== View Conformance Status 

You can view governance conformance status in Exchange for versions of API definitions. The status is one of the following:
 
* *Conformant*: The API definition is conformant to governance rulesets against which it has been validated.
* *Not Conformant*: The API definition is not conformant to governance rulesets against which it has been validated.
* *Not Validated*: The API definition is not validated against governance rulesets.

Conformance status can be viewed in Exchange as follows:

* A conformance badge is displayed for a selected version of an API.
* In the *Manage Versions* page, a *Conformance* column shows conformance status for each version of the API. 
* A *Conformance Status* page appears for all REST APIs and AsyncAPIs. If a selected version of an API has been validated against governance rulesets, the conformance status page gives conformance information and gives options to fix nonconformant versions.

To view conformance status:

. Select an API with governance rulesets.
. Review the conformance badge.
. To view conformance by version, click *Manage Versions*.
. Review the *Conformance* column, which shows the governance conformance status for each validated version.
+
. To view conformance details, select *Conformance Status* in the left navigation bar. From the conformance status page, you can:
+
* Select the version of the API that you want to view.
* View the lists of centralized governance rulesets and additional rulesets against which the API has been validated.
** If there are more rulesets than are shown on the initial page, click the *Show All* link to show the full list.
** Click the external link icon beside a ruleset to view that ruleset asset's page. 
* For nonconformant APIs, click *Fix the API Definition* and then select from one of the following:
** *Fix Using Design Center*
+ 
After your API definition is opened in Design Center, add the listed rulesets as dependencies and view the conformance messages in the *Project Errors* section to fix and republish your API definition.
** *Instructions for Anypoint CLI*
+
Follow the instructions on the page to copy, update, and run the Anypoint CLI commands to dd the listed rulesets as dependencies and fix and republish your API definition.


== Test an API with API Notebook

Many APIs have an API notebook for interactive testing.

. Click *API Notebook* in the content page.
. Read the description and usage information.
. Click *Play* to test the method in the code example.
. Exchange shows the results in real time.
. Experiment with the example in the code block to try different parameters and values.
