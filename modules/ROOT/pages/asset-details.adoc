NOTE: The current documentation provides information about the new UI for the asset details page, which includes the lifecycle states feature. The previous UI does not include lifecycle states. 

The asset details page provides comprehensive information about an asset. You can view version agnostic information, share and download, view code, manage versions and lifecycle states, add categories and tags, edit the documentation, and test API endpoints. 

See xref:workflow-sharing-assets.adoc[Workflow: Publish Assets] for more information about performing these functions.

Select an asset in Exchange to view the asset details page:

image::exchange-asset-detail-view.png[Asset details]

The left navigation bar lists:

* Additional pages
* Saved search terms
* Application names
* Instances
* The HTTP functions in the REST specification (for a REST API)
* Terms and conditions and APIs using this policy (for a policy)

The top asset detail pane provides the following information:

* Asset name 
* Description
* Asset type
* Organization
* Owner name
* Owner email
* Asset creation date 
* Last updated date
* Version 
* Categories  and tags of the asset
* Lifecycle state
* Share by inviting users to have access
* For APIs, download specifications and view code
* Add a new version


For REST APIs, use the right pane to test the API by creating example calls and test data (mocking), so you can send data to the API and view the results.

From the asset details pane, you can collapse and expand metadata such as major and minor versions, last published, and categories and tags. Use the *Manage versions* button to view a table of the asset patch versions. The table lists the version, instances, and the lifecycle state of dependent assets. You can add a new version of the asset, view version details, and delete a version. See xref:manage-versions.adoc[Manage Versions] for more information.

The documentation pane displays the asset documentation. The documentation can be edited by an administrator or the asset owner by clicking *Edit documentation*. 

== View Assets by Business Group

A system administrator groups individuals within an organization into business groups. Each group has its own Exchange assets. 

To view the business groups, log in to Anypoint Platform and click a group name from the taskbar:

image::ex2-biz-groups.png[Screenshot - Business groups in upper taskbar drop-down menu]

An Exchange administrator sets the groups that this menu shows to each user.

If you cannot find an asset in the current business group scopes, search in other scopes. In the left navigation menu click *All assets* (assets provided by MuleSoft and your own root organization), *Provided by MuleSoft*, or a business group scope.

== View REST API Elements in an Asset

View RAML, OAS, or AsyncAPI API specification information, including resources and the methods in each resource, in the left navigation bar.

. Click a method button:
+
image::ex2-rest-ftns.png[Screenshot - REST API function buttons in left nav bar]
+
. Experiment with the API in the right side of a method view.
+
This is similar to using a program such as Postman to specify custom HTTP headers and test each API's method using the API's endpoint.
. To connect the API to one of your applications and use the API to send and receive data, click *Request access*.

== Test an API with API Notebook

Many APIs have an API notebook for interactive testing.

. Click *API Notebook* in the content page.
. Read the description and usage information.
. Click *Play* to test the method in the code example.
. Exchange shows the results in real time.
. Experiment with the example in the code block to try different parameters and values.
