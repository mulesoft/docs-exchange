The asset details page provides comprehensive information about an asset. You can view version agnostic information, share the asset with others or publish it on the public portal, download a copy of the asset, view code, manage versions and lifecycle states, add categories and tags, edit the documentation, and test API endpoints. 

The current documentation provides information about the new UI for the asset details page, which includes the lifecycle states feature. The previous UI does not include lifecycle states. 

See xref:workflow-sharing-assets.adoc[Workflow: Publish Assets] for more information about performing these functions.

Select an asset in Exchange to view the asset details page:

image::exchange-asset-detail-view.png[Asset details]

The left navigation bar lists:

* Additional pages
* Saved search terms
* Application names
* Instances
* The HTTP functions in the REST specification (for a REST API)
* Conformance Status
* Terms and conditions and APIs using this policy (for a policy)

The top asset detail pane provides the following information:

* Asset name 
* Description
* Asset type
* Organization
* Contact name
* Contact email
* Asset creation date 
* Last updated date
* Version 
* Categories and tags of the asset
* Lifecycle state
* Conformance state
* Share by inviting users to have access
* For APIs, download specifications and view code
* Add a new version

For REST APIs, use the right pane to create example calls and mock data to test the API.

From the asset details pane, you can collapse and expand metadata such as version, last published, and categories and tags. See version information by clicking *View versions*. Administrators can use *Manage versions* to add a new version of the asset, view version details, and delete a version. See xref:manage-versions.adoc[Manage Versions] for more information.

The documentation page displays the asset documentation. The documentation can be edited by an administrator or the asset owner by clicking *Edit documentation*. 


== View REST API Elements in an Asset

View RAML, OAS, or AsyncAPI API specification information, including resources and the methods in each resource, in the left navigation bar.

. Click a method button:
+
image::ex2-rest-ftns.png[Screenshot - REST API function buttons in left nav bar]
+
. Experiment with the API in the right side of a method view.
+
This is similar to using a program such as Postman to specify custom HTTP headers and test each API's method using the API's endpoint.
. To connect the API to one of your applications and use the API to send and receive data, click *Request access*.

== Search API Specification and Pages

The assets details page enables you to find specific information within the pages and API specification of an asset using the CTRL+F or the command+F keyboard shortcut. In Exchange, this enhanced shortcut overrides the native browser shortcut, which only searches for words and phrases on the current page. To quickly find the information you need, use this enhanced shortcut to search the content of every page and the API specification of an asset.

To search pages and the API specification using the enhanced find shortcut:
  
. In the asset details page, press CTRL+f or command+f.
. . In the *Search content* box, enter a search term or phrase.
. Click a search result from the list.
. Use the up and down arrows to move through all the occurrences of the search term within the search results.
. Click the *X* to close the Search content box.

The enhanced keyboard shortcut looks for terms or phrases in:

* Pages
* Home
* Additional pages
* Specification
* Summary
* Endpoints
* Documentation
* Types
* Security

When you enter a search term or phrase in the search box, the search results box displays the sections within Pages and Specification that contain the search terms entered. Click the search result to open the page with the search term or phrase highlighted. The search result shows the number of search-term matches in each page. Use the arrows to move up or down in the list of search results and to the next page.

For example, enter the term *ruleset* in the Search content box. Under Pages, there are three search results for ruleset in the Home page. Click *Home* to open the page. Use the up and down arrows to find all of the highlighted instances of ruleset in the Home page.

== View Governed APIs for a Ruleset

// Include the governed apis for rulesets page partial doc

include::exchange::partial$task-view-governed-apis-for-rulesets.adoc[]


== Test an API with API Notebook

Many APIs have an API notebook for interactive testing.

. Click *API Notebook* in the content page.
. Read the description and usage information.
. Click *Play* to test the method in the code example.
. Exchange shows the results in real time.
. Experiment with the example in the code block to try different parameters and values.
