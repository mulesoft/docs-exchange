The legacy search experience is also known as the old search option on the Exchange UI. This search experience is available in Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, MuleSoft Government Cloud, the US cloud, and the EU cloud. This search experience does not include enhanced options for searching by rank, organizations, and lifecycle states. 

To access the legacy search, click *Back to old search* from the landing page.

Discover assets by searching for specific assets from the landing page of the Exchange catalog. 

== Display Assets in List or Grid View

You have an option to display the catalog of assets in list or grid view. List view arranges assets in a list format and grid view displays the assets in tiles. Both views sort the assets by the latest modified date and display the asset name, type, modified date, rating, and created by information.

== Filter

You can filter search results by asset types for example, API groups, REST APIs, and rulesets by selecting an option from the *All types* drop-down menu. The options that appear depend on which types are available within an organization.
 
 
== Search in Organization

You can search only in the Exchange organization that you are currently viewing. If you are viewing a private Exchange organization, the search lists only that organizationâ€™s assets and not MuleSoft public assets.

== Save a Search

Search criteria that is used often can be saved for quick discovery of specific assets.

. Enter a search term and click *Save This Search*.
. When prompted, give the search a name and select whether the search is an organization search or personal search.
+
Administrators can save searches visible to anyone in their current business group. Personal searches are visible only to the person who creates them.
. Save the search.
. Confirm that your search appears in the saved searches in the left navigation bar.
+
Exchange lists search terms specific to your business group. Below those terms are saved searches you created:

== Search API Specifications

The following API specification properties are used in search:

* API title
* Base URI
* Endpoints
** Path
** Display name
** Description
* Methods
** Method type (GET, POST, PUT)
** Description
* Query parameters
** Name
** Description
* URI parameters
** Name
* Types
** Name
** Properties
* Traits
* Properties
* Security schemas

These property names are based on RAML specifications. Equivalent properties are indexed for OAS specifications. For example, RAML uses base URI but OAS uses host and path.

This example shows an API specification:

Note that the last two searches are the same, because special characters are removed before searching.

== Search for Phrases 

You can search for case-insensitive text that begins with each word you specify, put a space between words. This is similar to putting the `*` wildcard regular expression after each word. For example, searching for `mq module` finds any asset that has text that starts with `mq` or `module`.

Searching for a multiple word phrase shows assets that have every word in the phrase.

If you separate search words with any non-alphanumeric character other than a space, Anypoint Exchange converts the character to a space before searching.

=== Search Phrases 

To search for case-insensitive text that begins with each word you specify, put a space between words.
This is similar to putting the `*` wildcard regular expression after each word.

For example, searching for `mq module` finds any asset that has text that
starts with `mq` or `module`.

Searching for a multiple word phrase shows assets that have every word in the phrase.

If you separate search words with any non-alphanumeric character other than a space, Anypoint Exchange
converts the character to a space before searching.

=== Search Separators

The search experience uses search separators to find Exchange assets that contain one or more terms.

If you input search words connected by non-alphanumeric symbols, Exchange replaces the symbols with spaces before searching for the term. The search string only succeeds if both words are present in the result. This is the same as the `word1 AND word2` relationship.

Example search terms:

[source,text,linenums]
----
sales:connect
Sales-Connect
connect:/sales
-connect -sales
----

This table shows how each search term is interpreted based on the values in the asset name,
asset ID, and tags for an asset. If the search term maps to the values correctly, a match occurs. If not,
the reason is provided.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Asset Name |Asset ID |Tags |Matches?
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |mule-Connector |Yes
|Salesforce Connector |salesforce-connector |REST |Yes
|Validations API |validations-api |salesforce-connecting |Yes
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, salesforce:enabled |Yes
|Cisco Sales API  |cisco-sales-api |Connecting, Productive |Yes
|Cisco Connector |cisco-connector |com.cisco.connector.sales
|Yes, because the tag is split into separate terms.
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |muleconnector, MuleConnector |No. `connect` was not found.
|Salesforce Connec |salesforce-connec |REST |No. `connect` was not found.
|Validations API |validations-api |connector |No. `sales` was not found.
|Cisco Presales API |cisco-presales-api |Connector, api |No. `sales` was not found.
|===

=== Phrase Search Separators

Use phrase search to find a group of terms inside quotation marks. Phrase searches match an asset only if all the exact terms inside quotes appear in consecutive order.

If you input any of these searches in Exchange, Exchange replaces non-alphanumeric symbols with spaces before searching for assets.

Example search terms:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Api: "Sales connect"
Api "Sales-connect"
Api "Sales:/connect"
Api-"Sales/connect"
"Sales connect":Api
----

This table shows how each search term is interpreted based on the values in the asset name,

|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, sales:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/sales, connect:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found, because each term is in different tags.

== Search by Types, Tags, Categories, and Custom Fields 

You can enter search text to search for assets. Click *All Types* to set a filter for specific asset types, or combine search text with the filters listed in the type menu.

The search experience uses query language to search assets by tags, categories, and custom fields.

=== Search by Tags

Search by tags using either `tag:"some value"` or `tag:value`.

If the value has no spaces, then double quotes are optional.

Tag search is case-insensitive.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Tags |Matches?
|tag:"some value" |some value |Yes
|tag:"some value" |value |No
|tag:"value" |value |Yes
|tag:value |value |Yes
|tag:VALUE |value |Yes
|tag:VaLuE |value |Yes
|tag:value |val |No
|===

=== Search by Categories

Search by categories using `category:"some key" = "some value"`.

If the category has no spaces in the key or value, then double quotes are optional.

The key can include the asterisk (`*`) regular expression to search for characters within a category name.

The key is case-sensitive.

A search value matches an asset value if either of these is true:

* The search value is entirely lowercase.
* The letter case of the search value and the asset value match.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Category |Matches?
|category:my-key = my-value |my-key:my-value |Yes
|category:my-key = MY-VALUE |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|category:my-key = my-value |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|category:"my key" = "my value" |my key:my value |Yes
|category:"key" = "value" |my key:my value |No
|category:key = value |my-key:my-value |No
|category:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|category:*my.key = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|category:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|category:this.* = some-* |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|===

You can search for a combination of different categories. You cannot search for multiple values of the same category.

Multiple search terms use an implicit `AND`. `OR` is not supported.

These search terms return all assets marked as both system APIs and Salesforce products:

`category:"API Type" = "System API" category:"Product" = "Salesforce"`

=== Search by Custom Fields

Search by fields using `field:"some key" = "some value"`.

If the custom field has no spaces in the key or value, then double quotes are optional.

The key can include the asterisk (`*`) regular expression to search for characters within a field name.

The key is case-sensitive.

A search value matches an asset value if either of these is true:

* The search value is entirely lowercase.
* The letter case of the search value and the asset value match.
Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Field |Matches?
|field:my-key = my-value |my-key:my-value |Yes
|field:my-key = MY-VALUE |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|field:my-key = my-value |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|field:my-key = My-ValUe |my-key:MY-VALUE |No
|field:MY-KEY = my-value |my-key:my-value |No
|field:my-key = 10 |my-key:10 |Yes
|field:"my key" = "my value" |my key:my value |Yes
|field:"key" = "value" |my key:my value |No
|field:key = value |my-key:my-value |No
|field:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|field:*my.key = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|field:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|field:this.* = some-* |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
