Exchange administrators can view usage and engagement metrics for API specification fragments and REST APIs using the dashboard. The usage metrics measure how many times an asset is downloaded from Exchange, imported from API Designer, and imported from Anypoint Studio. The asset engagement score is a composite metric that administrators and asset owners can use to measure the usage of the assets in Exchange. The results for this engagement are the different consumption actions that end-users make across different points of need within Exchange. The engagement score reflects the usage of the asset in the context of the usage for all assets in the customer root organization and business groups. 

The dashboard displays the metrics for the top assets for a period of the last 7 days, 30 days, or 60 days that are ranked by the most consumption events. You can filter the top assets by API specification fragments and REST API types and by one or more organizations. Export metric data into a CSV file by clicking CSV to Export.
