Anypoint Exchange is a curated catalog of reusable assets such as APIs, policies, API spec fragments, API groups, templates, examples, custom assets, and integration assets such as connectors. You can catalog (publish), share, discover, learn about, and reuse assets within your organization to facilitate collaboration, boost productivity, and promote standards.

Use Exchange to discover, share, and incorporate assets and resources into your applications. Exchange helps you create API developer portals, view and test APIs, simulate sending data to APIs by using the mocking service, create assets, and use API Notebooks to describe and test API functions.

Exchange assets are accessible in Anypoint Studio (connectors, templates, and examples), API Manager (APIs, API groups, and policies), and Runtime Manager (APIs), and you can publish APIs from Design Center to Exchange.

Assets under the *Provided by MuleSoft* organization are created by MuleSoft and its partners, and are certified by Mulesoft. These assets are publicly available to all customers as well. However, all assets that are created by an organization and published into the organization's instance of Exchange, are private and not visible outside that organizationCustomers are responsible for any private assets they publish within their Exchange instance.

== Get Started

. From the https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange], search for assets using filters. If you know the name of the asset, enter the name in the *Search* field. 
. Select an asset from the search results view.
. Review the description of the asset.

To create assets for APIs, connectors, templates, examples, API Notebooks, and custom assets, log into Exchange. See xref:workflow-sharing-assets[Workflow: Publish APIs] for more information.

== Try APIs

. Click the *All Types* filter, check the REST APIs option, and click *Apply*.
. Click the asset and notice how the API functions appear in the left
navigation bar. Exchange lets you view the functions in an API.
. Click a function and more information appears. At the right side of the screen, you can test the API by entering sample values to send to the API and get responses from the API.

== Need More Information on an Asset?
