Anypoint Exchange is a curated catalog of reusable assets such as APIs, policies, API spec fragments, API groups, GraphQL APIs, templates, examples, custom assets, rulesets, and integration assets such as connectors. See xref:asset-types.adoc[Asset Types] for more information about each type of asset. You can catalog (publish), share, discover, learn about, and reuse assets within your organization to facilitate collaboration, boost productivity, and promote standards.

Use Exchange to discover, share, and incorporate assets and resources into your applications. Exchange helps you create API developer portals, view and test APIs, simulate sending data to APIs by using the mocking service, create assets, and use API Notebooks to describe and test API functions.

Exchange assets are accessible from many places like Anypoint Studio (connectors, templates, and examples), API Manager (APIs, API groups, and policies), or Runtime Manager (applications). APIs can be published from Design Center to Exchange.

Assets in the *Provided by MuleSoft* organization are created by MuleSoft and its partners and certified by Mulesoft. These assets are publicly available to all customers. However, assets that are created by an organization other than *Provided by MuleSoft* and published in that organization's instance of Exchange are private and not visible outside that organization. Customers are responsible for any private assets they publish within their Exchange instance.

== Get Started

You can get started either by searching for an existing asset or creating a new one.

. From https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange], either search by type of assets or enter the name of a known asset in the *Search assets* field.
. Select an asset from the search results view.
. Review the description of the asset.

To create assets for APIs, connectors, templates, examples, API Notebooks, and custom assets, log into Exchange. See xref:workflow-sharing-assets.adoc[Workflow: Publish APIs] for more information.

== Test APIs

You can test APIs using the mocking service.

. Click the *All Types* filter, select the REST APIs option, and click *Apply*.
. Click the asset and notice how the API functions appear in the left
navigation bar. 
. Click a function and more information appears. At the right side of the screen, you can test the API by entering sample values to send to the API and get responses from the API.


== Language Support

Using multiple languages with Unicode is supported fully throughout Exchange and in all metadata fields, including asset names, descriptions, markdown pages, categories, tags, and reviews.
