All public portals in Exchange are enabled by default. You can sign in to your portal, view assets, and share new assets. Enabled portals do not require authorization to view asset details or download a specification. If you do not want the portal to be publicly shared, you can manually disable it. You must be an Exchange administrator to enable or disable a public portal.

To determine whether your public portal is enable or disable, use the following request:

----
curl "https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/api/v2/portals/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_DOMAIN/status"
----

== Enable a Public Portal

----
ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -XPOST -d "username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD" | jq -r ".access_token")
----

. Use the access token to change the status of your organization's public portal to enabled status:
+
----
