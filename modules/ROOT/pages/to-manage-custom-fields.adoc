Exchange administrators and organization owners can create custom fields to extend the Exchange asset metadata model and add custom data to any type of asset.

A custom field is a key-value pair that can be added to an asset version.

Custom fields are managed, which means each asset type has a specific schema defined by an administrator. This enables Exchange to validate the values. For example, an asset can have a custom field configuration named "SupportEndDate," and Exchange can ensure that the value set for this field is a valid date.

Exchange shows custom fields in an asset's overview section:

== Get an Access Token

Get an access token with a cURL command such as the following. Optionally, instead of sending HTTP commands with cURL, you can use Postman or another application.

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your Anypoint Platform user account name and replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your password.

[source,console]
----
ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -XPOST -d "username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD" | jq -r ".access_token")
----

Use this access token in your API calls to configure and assign custom fields.

== Supported Types

Exchange supports custom fields of the types enum, number, date, text, list of numbers, and list of strings.
