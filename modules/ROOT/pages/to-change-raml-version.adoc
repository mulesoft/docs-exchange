Changing a RAML version cannot be done in Anypoint Exchange. Instead, you can change the RAML version
either in the RAML specification itself or when you publish to Anypoint Exchange using Design Center.

From the RAML specification:

Change the `version:` element in your RAML specification.
You can use a text editor or API Designer in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.
When you update the version element in the RAML specification and publish to Exchange, the publish
menu automatically picks up the change from the `version:` element.

When you publish to Exchange:

. From Design Center, open your API. No changes are necessary.
. Click the Publish to Exchange button (image:ex-publish-to-exchange-button.png[]).

. Change the API Version value. You can also change the Asset Version (the version of the Exchange asset).
