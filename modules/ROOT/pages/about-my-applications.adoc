The My Applications area in the Exchange details view for an asset lists
applications that hold a contract between an API and a user.

image::ex2-my-applications.png[]

A contract holds information about the contract with a client ID and client secret for the API.
Each application lists a description, its URL, redirect URIs, grant types, and a usage dashboard.

The usage information lets you set the verification duration. If not specified,
the range is the last 8 days. The usage lists the total number of requests to
the API, average latency, the error rate, and graphs for total requests,
average latency, requests by HTTP status code, and the error percentage.

The applications result when users click Request Access to establish
a link between an application and an API. Either the application already exists,
or the user creates the application from the Request Access menu.

Applications in My Applications are registered using API Manager in Anypoint Platform.

Requesting access registers a client and creates an API contract between an API
and a client application.

APIs that have been protected by a client ID enforcement policy require
applications to have a client ID and client secret. This enables the
application to access the API and provides consumer analytics for an API
developer.

API contracts are visible to API consumers in Exchange, and visible to API
providers in API Manager.
