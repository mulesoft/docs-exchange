You can view governance conformance status in Exchange for versions of API definitions. The status is one of the following:
 
* *Conformant*: The API definition is conformant to governance rulesets against which it has been validated.
* *Not Conformant*: The API definition is not conformant to governance rulesets against which it has been validated.
* *Not Validated*: The API definition is not validated against governance rulesets.

Conformance status can be viewed in Exchange as follows:

* A conformance badge is displayed for a selected version of an API.
* In the *Manage Versions* page, a *Conformance* column shows conformance status for each version of the API. 
* A *Conformance Status* page appears for all REST APIs and AsyncAPIs. If a selected version of an API has been validated against governance rulesets, the conformance status page gives conformance information and gives options to fix nonconformant versions.

To view conformance status:

. Select a REST API or AsyncAPI.
. Review the conformance badge.
. To view conformance by version, click *Manage Versions*.
. Review the *Conformance* column, which shows the governance conformance status for each validated version.
+
. To view conformance details, select *Conformance Status* in the left navigation bar. From the conformance status page, you can:
+
* Select the version of the API that you want to view.
* View the lists of centralized governance rulesets and additional rulesets against which the API has been validated.
** If there are more rulesets than are shown on the initial page, click the *Show All* link to show the full list.
** Click the external link icon beside a ruleset to view that ruleset asset's page. 
* For nonconformant APIs, click *Fix the API Definition* and then select from one of the following:
** *Fix Using Design Center*
+ 
After your API definition is opened in Design Center, add the listed rulesets as dependencies and view the conformance messages in the *Project Errors* section to fix and republish your API definition.
** *Fix Using Anypoint CLI*
+
Follow the prompts on the page to copy, update, and run the Anypoint CLI commands to dd the listed rulesets as dependencies and fix and republish your API definition.
