The HTTP API lets Private Exchange users specify a placeholder for an endpoint. After you create the HTTP API endpoint, you can optionally manage the endpoint with API Manager.

The HTTP API asset contains a description for what the API endpoint does and how users can utilize the API for use with their programs.

Users utilize API Manager to import the API from Exchange and can then associate proxies and manage policies and SLAs for the API.

. In a Private Exchange, click New.
. Give the API a name and in Asset Type, click API - HTTP.
. Click Publish.
. In the asset view, click Edit to provide a description.
. Click Save As Draft and Publish.
