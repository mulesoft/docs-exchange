You can edit an asset's portal, change its name, icon, description, tags, categories, and custom fields, and add portal pages with content.

All versions of an asset have the same name, icon, description, and computed average rating.

Each minor version of an asset has its own tags, categories, custom fields, and content pages, including an optional page of terms and conditions.

In Exchange, open the asset list and select the asset. Exchange shows the asset portal.

Images uploaded before May 2019 can be accessed without authentication, and images uploaded after May 2019 require authentication. To disable unauthenticated access to an image uploaded before May 2019, download it, delete it, and upload it again.

=== API Groups

If any API in an API Group has a terms and conditions page, then the API Group has a terms and conditions page that cannot be deleted and that shows the terms and conditions of the underlying APIs.

Optionally, you may add more terms and conditions to the API Group's terms and conditions page.


=== Editor Notes

* To use the link control, type text, select the text, and click the link control to specify the link URL.
* If your Exchange session times out while you're editing, select all the text on the page and copy it to your
clipboard. Then after you log back in, you can paste the content back into the page and save your draft. When a timeout occurs, unsaved content is purged.
* You can access international characters by pressing and holding a character.
* If you are editing descriptions for many assets, instead of clicking an asset to open it from Exchange, instead right-click the asset and click Open Link in New Window to open the asset in a new browser window. Otherwise, after you publish an asset, control returns to the start of the filter/search list.
