You can edit an asset's portal; change its name, icon, description, tags, categories, and custom fields; and add portal pages with content.

All versions of an asset have the same name, icon, description, and computed average rating.

Each minor version of an asset has its own tags, categories, custom fields, and content pages, including an optional page of terms and conditions.

In Exchange, open the asset list and select the asset. Exchange shows the asset portal.

== Edit Asset Portal Name

. Select the asset portal name or the pen icon after the name.
. Enter the new name.
. (Optional) To cancel the changes, select the cancel icon.
. To save the new name, press the enter or return key on your keyboard, or select the check icon.

NOTE: Before the August 2019 release, the versions of an asset could have different names. After the August 2019 release, a new name applies to all versions of the asset.


== Edit Asset Icon

. Select the pen icon beside the asset icon.
. Select an image.
. (Optional) To remove an asset icon, select the cancel icon beside the asset icon.

NOTE: Before the August 2019 release, the versions of an asset could have different icons. After the August 2019 release, a new asset icon applies to all versions of the asset.


== Edit Asset Description

. Select the pen icon after the asset description.
. Enter the new asset description.
. (Optional) To cancel the changes, select the cancel icon.
. To save the new name, select the check icon.

NOTE: The asset description applies to all versions of the asset.


== Add Asset Tags

You can search by tag name for assets in Exchange.

Tags can only be lower case, and upper case tags are converted to lowercase. Special characters are permitted. An asset can have any number of tags.

. In the sidebar *Tags* list select *Add a tag*.
. Enter the new tag.
. Press the enter or return key on your keyboard.


== Remove Asset Tags

To remove a tag, in the sidebar *Tags* list, select the *X* next to the tag text.


== Edit Asset Portal

. Select *Edit*.
. Enter the new portal content.
. In the editor you can change the appearance of text and insert code samples, block quotes, and horizontal lines.
. Add images and videos as described below.
. After you write the main page, select either *Discard changes* or *Save as draft*. You can edit and save a draft any number of times before publishing. Drafts are not visible to other users until they are published. When an asset has an unpublished draft, Exchange displays a *Go to draft* button to edit it.
. Add secondary pages and terms and conditions as described below.
. After you edit and save all your pages, publish the portal by selecting *Publish*.
. Your asset portal is now visible to everyone in the organization.

=== Add an Image

You can copy and paste an image directly into the Exchange page:

. Select *Edit*.
. Select *Visual mode*.
. If your image is on your computer, drag the image to the Exchange page, or copy and paste to the Exchange page.
+
If the image is on a web server, copy the image and paste it into the Exchange page.

Alternatively, select the image icon in the editor and provide a URL to an illustration available on the web.

In Markdown, use this syntax to reference a web served image:

`+![some alt text](http://www.example.com/image/png.png)+`

Images uploaded before May 2019 can be accessed without authentication, and images uploaded after May 2019 require authentication. To disable unauthenticated access to an image uploaded before May 2019, download it, delete it, and upload it again.


=== Add Secondary Pages

. Select *Edit*.
. In the left navigation area, select *Add New Page* and press the enter or return key on your keyboard to create the page. You can create as many pages as needed. In Exchange Portals, click *Add Content Pages*.
. Add a description to the page. Secondary pages support the same options as the main page.
. After creating a page, select *Save As Draft*.
. After you edit and save all your pages, select *Publish*.

In Edit mode, you can reorder pages by clicking the page name and dragging the page up or down in the left nav bar.

All page names are validated:

* Page name length must be from 1 to 128 characters.
* A page name cannot be the reserved name `home`.
* Page names cannot be the name of an existing page.
* Page names cannot contain these characters: `@` `*` `+` `/` `_` `\`
* Page names cannot start with `.`

When you rename a documentation page, Exchange automatically creates a new URL for the page and a redirect from the old URL to the new URL.


=== Specify Terms and Conditions

. Select an asset and select *Edit*.
. Select *Add Terms and Conditions*: image:ex2-terms.png[Terms and Conditions button]
. Use the editor to specify the terms and conditions for this asset.
. Select *Save As Draft*.
. Select *Publish*.

NOTE: Terms and conditions are only available for API assets. Users are prompted to accept the terms and conditions when requesting API access.


=== API Groups

If any API in an API Group has a terms and conditions page, then the API Group has a terms and conditions page that cannot be deleted and that shows the terms and conditions of the underlying APIs.

Optionally, you may add more terms and conditions to the API Group's terms and conditions page.


=== Editor Notes

* To use the link control, type text, select the text, and click the link control to specify the link URL.
* If your Exchange session times out while you're editing, select all the text on the page and copy it to your
clipboard. Then after you log back in, you can paste the content back into the page and save your draft. When a timeout occurs, unsaved content is purged.
* You can access international characters by pressing and holding a character.
* If you are editing descriptions for many assets, instead of clicking an asset to open it from Exchange, instead right-click the asset and click Open Link in New Window to open the asset in a new browser window. Otherwise, after you publish an asset, control returns to the start of the filter/search list.
* Keyboard shortcuts (work in Visual and Markdown): Bold: ctrl-b/cmd-b, Italics: ctrl-i/cmd-i, Heading: ctrl-d/cmd-d, Blockquote: ctrl-e/cmd-e, Code Block: ctrl-j/cmd-j, Numbered List: ctrl-o/cmd-o, Bullet List: ctrl-u/cmd-u, Insert Link: ctrl-k/cmd-k.
